# cern-kubernetes-scaling-case-study

How CERN uses Kubernetes to scale scientific workloads, process 90+PB data, and run 1000s of jobs.

This repository presents a detailed case study of how CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, leverages Kubernetes to orchestrate containerized scientific workloads, automate physics simulations, and scale infrastructure to handle over 90 petabytes of particle collision data annually. It includes a carousel breakdown, tools stack, impact analysis, and key takeaways for cloud-native DevOps at research scale.
